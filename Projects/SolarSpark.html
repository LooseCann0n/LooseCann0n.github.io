                <p class="description">
                    Since I had prior experience in creating a camera system I was chosen to make it. It would need to be fast and responsive, in align with the fast paced hack and slash combat system. We drew inspiration
                    from games such as <i>Devil May Cry 5</i> and <i>NieR: Automata</i>.
                </p>

                <div class=".container">
                    <img src="../Images/nier.jpg">
                </div>

                <p class="description">
                    I decided to use <i>Cinemachine</i> for the camera system rather than creating my own from scratch. Cinemachine has many advantages such as:

                    <!-- CineMachine pros list -->
                    <ul>
                        <li>Development time saved can be allocated elsewhere</li>
                        <li>It is highly customisable with a camera suitable for any genre of game</li>
                        <li>Supported by Unity as an offical package with its own documentation</li>
                        <li>Changes are quick to make, mostly by changing values on components unless custom behaviours are required</li>
                    </ul>


                    In order to test the camera, I created a small environment with a variety of different walls to simulate the different elevations
                    that the camera would have to deal with. I chose to use "" as it was most similar to a 3rd person follow. After coming up with a prototype
                    that I was pleased with, I showed the progress to the team. The changes I made were to move the camera further back. We felt that it being
                    close to the player could make it difficult to anticipate enemy movements. 

                    <br>
                    
                    Later on in the project we were given feedback that we needed to improve game feel. Using <i>Cinemachine impulse</i> allowed me add camera shake,
                    via an event. This meant that when the player dealt damage to enemies, used a special attack or took damage. There would be a small amount
                    of shake. This achieved the intended effect of improving combat feel.
